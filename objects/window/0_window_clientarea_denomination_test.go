// ClientArea is what a dropdown from the window's own menu bar divides by
// its row height to decide how many items fit, and so whether to scroll at
// all. Its doc says it is "expressed in that menu bar's local coordinate
// space" -- and the bar works in the window's INTERIOR denomination, while
// the bounds and chrome rect it is built from are in the OUTER one.
//
// Handing the outer number over unconverted made the dropdown divide a
// height in one currency by a row height in another, so the row count came
// out wrong by the ratio between them: too few rows in a finely denominated
// window (scroll bumpers on a menu that fits) and too many in a coarse one
// (no scrolling on a menu that overflows).
//
// The claim is that the space stays the same size however it is counted.
