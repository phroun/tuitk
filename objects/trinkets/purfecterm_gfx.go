package trinkets

// The graphical paint path for PurfecTerm (D1): a faithful port of
// the reference gtk/qt widget renderers onto KittyTK's Painter and the
// shared text engine. It drives purfecterm.Buffer directly - screen
// splits, sprites, custom glyphs, screen scale/crop, selection,
// blink animation, cursor shapes with the unfocused hollow-box form,
// scrollbars, autoscroll, and the right-click context menu.
//
// Porting notes (deliberate deltas from the gtk reference):
//   - terminalLeftPadding is 0: KittyTK trinkets own their full bounds.
//   - Rect fills round to whole units edge-to-edge (no seams);
//     glyphs, sprites, and cursor overlays keep device-pixel
//     precision through Painter.DrawImageOffset.
//   - Scrollbars are overlay lanes inside the trinket (macOS style)
//     instead of composed native widgets.
