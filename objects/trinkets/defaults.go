// The size a trinket asks for when nothing set one.
//
// The size is a count of denomination units. These are written as counts of
// CELLS -- so many * UnitsPerCellWidth across, so many * UnitsPerCellHeight down -- only
// because a default cannot be derived any other way: the units are the
// surface's, and nothing here can know what a designer would have specified
// in them.
//
// They are deliberately too small to use. A trinket laid out at one of these
// is a designer being told they forgot to give it a size.
