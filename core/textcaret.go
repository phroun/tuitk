// The text caret is the platform's OWN cursor — the one a terminal draws and
// blinks itself, in whatever shape DECSCUSR selected. It is distinct from the
// mouse cursor (see cursor.go) and from any caret a trinket paints into its own
// cells.
//
// A trinket that wants it calls Painter.RequestTextCaret during Paint, in its
// local coordinates; the painter transforms them to surface coordinates. The
// surface host applies the frame's request after painting (see SurfaceHost).
//
// Two rules give the caret to the right trinket with no policy code:
//
//   - A trinket requests it only while it holds keyboard focus, so an unfocused
//     terminal keeps painting its own caret instead.
//   - The LAST request of a frame wins, and painting runs back to front, so an
//     overlay, a menu, or a torn-off window painted above the content takes the
//     caret from whatever is underneath.
//
// A frame with no request leaves the platform caret hidden.

// TextCaret is one frame's platform-caret request, in surface coordinates.

	// Color is the ink the caret is drawn in, or ColorDefault to leave the
	// reader's own setting alone.
	//
	// A terminal's caret colour is a global preference, chosen once against a
	// terminal's own background -- so on a trinket that paints a background of
	// its own it can land somewhere it cannot be seen. A trinket that knows
	// what it painted can say what shows up on it; anything else says nothing
	// and gets the colour the reader picked.

	// InputArea marks (X, Y) as the INSERTION POINT for an input method,
	// whether or not the platform draws a caret there.
	//
	// The two are not the same question. A terminal wants the platform's
	// caret AND is the insertion point, so RequestTextCaret sets both. A
	// text field draws its own caret — a blinking bar, or a reverse-video
	// block on a cell surface — and asking for the platform's would paint
	// two; it wants only this, so an input method can put its candidate
	// window under the text being typed instead of at a default corner.
