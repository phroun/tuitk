// A BAND is one track of a grid: a column, or a row. It is the same idea on
// either axis -- a line the children of a grid start and end on -- so it is
// one type, and which axis a band belongs to is decided by the list it is put
// in rather than by anything it says about itself.
//
// Bands are given in order and take their index from their position, so a
// form never writes a track number down. A band that names itself can be
// placed into by that name, which survives an insertion ahead of it that a
// number would not.

	// ID is the name children place themselves by (column="fields"). Blank
	// leaves the band reachable only by its position.

	// Stretch is this band's share of what is left once every band has its
	// minimum. Zero takes none of it.
	Stretch int

	// Minimum is the floor, in units, that the band holds whatever its
	// children ask for.
	Minimum core.Unit

	// Maximum is how far the band grows, in units, and MaximumSet says
	// whether it was given one -- zero is a real maximum, and collapses the
	// track, so a band that names none has to be told apart from one capped
	// at nothing. Ceiling is how to read the pair.
	//
	// A flag rather than the core.Unbounded a size property carries, because
	// a Band is written as a literal and its zero value has to be a band that
	// asks for nothing. It is the arrangement FlexHints.ShrinkSet already
	// uses, for the same reason.
