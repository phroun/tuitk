// two fillers, 2x its width in all). EndFrame decides per row: when EVERY cell
// on a terminal row belongs to the same DWL mode, the row is emitted as a real
// DEC line (ESC#6/#3/#4) using only the carrier glyphs; a mixed row (other

	// a browser tracking a held key — could not be given what the terminal was
	// never asked to send.
	//
	// AFTER the switch to the alternate screen, because the flag stack is
	// per-screen and this is the screen the application runs on. Pushed before
	// the switch it landed on the MAIN screen's stack, where nothing reads it:
	// the outer terminal went on sending legacy keys for the whole session, so
	// no release arrived however loudly this asked for one — and the push
	// outlived us on the screen the shell came back to, which is how the first
	// Ctrl+C after an exit printed "...9;5u" instead of interrupting.
	// Disambiguate (1) + ReportEvents (2) + ReportAllKeys (8).
	//
	// ReportAllKeys is what makes a keypad key arrive AS a keypad key. Without
	// it a terminal sends any key that produces text as that text and nothing
	// else, so the pad's 7 goes down as the byte "7" — indistinguishable from
	// the main row's, carrying no identity at all — while its repeats and its
	// release, which have no legacy form and must go as CSI u, carry keycode
	// 57406 and name the pad. One key, reported as two different keys, with a
	// release for a press nobody made.
	//
	// Disambiguate alone does not close this: it promotes the pad keys that
	// produce NO text, which is why P-Enter, P-Home and the pad arrows were
	// always right and only the locked pad was wrong. There is no narrower lever.
	// The application-keypad mode that would have been keypad-only is parsed and
	// discarded by the kitty terminal, the protocol's own reference
	// implementation (screen_alternate_keypad_mode, its handler for the mode,
	// is an empty function), so this flag is the whole of the mechanism.
	//
	// Disambiguation costs the text: with the keys reported as escape codes, a
	// text key arrives as its KEYCODE and nothing says what it produced. A
	// key's name is its character for most of them, so that passed unnoticed
	// until the two differed — and a dead key is where they do. Option+i then
	// "u" composes "û" and reports the U KEY, so a plain "u" went into the
	// document while the same keystroke worked in a host that never asked for
	// disambiguation at all.
	//
	// So flag 16 comes with it (11 + 16 = 27): report the associated text. The
	// key layer reads it as what the key TYPED in preference to what the key is
	// CALLED, and reports the protocol's keycode 0 — text the terminal received
	// with no key behind it, which is what an input method commits — prefixed,
	// as text rather than as a keystroke that never happened (see handleKey).
