// macOS Option-key decoding.
//
// On macOS the Option key composes text rather than acting as a plain Mega
// modifier: pressing Option+a produces the Unicode character "å", which arrives
// as an SDLTextInput event. Left untranslated that character is simply
// typed, so Meta shortcuts (Select All is M-a, etc.) never fire.
//
// The TUI backend already solves this in the direct-key-handler, whose
// gold-standard table maps each Option-composed character (US layout) back to
// its "M-key" notation. We mirror that table verbatim here and apply it to
// the SDLTextInput characters when running on macOS, so both backends emit the
// same key names for the same physical keystroke.

// macOSOptionChars maps the Unicode characters a US-layout macOS keyboard
// produces under Option (and Option+Shift) to the toolkit's M-key notation.
// Kept in sync with direct-key-handler's table of the same name.

// macOS reports these as an in-flight composition, and that is what the
// composition path was built for — but the same accent also arrives as ordinary
// committed text, and then it was recorded as what the chord typed. Anything
// falling through to what M-i types then inserted the accent, and the next
// keystroke composed the accented character behind it: "ˆû".
//
// So the accent is what identifies the case, not the event it came on. A dead
// key types nothing whichever way its accent is delivered.
